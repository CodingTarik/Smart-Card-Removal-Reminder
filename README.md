# Smart Card-Removal ReminderðŸ’³
This application runs in the background and reminds you with nice animations to remove your smart card from your smart card reader. You can also choose between pre-set snooze times at which you want to be reminded.

The program works only with Windows and the smart card reader function must be enabled.
